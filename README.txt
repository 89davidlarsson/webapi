Intro:
Decided to use a Web API project in Visual studio together with a couple of Nuget Packages, resulting in some autogenerated code.
Manually added parts are: BannersController (located in the controllers folder) and the entire Models folder.

Import the solution file into visual studio and run the application, in order to be able to test it. 

Storage:
Static in-memory database through a repository pattern.

Testing the API:
The application is using a Nuget Package, providing a Test Client connected to the Help Page.
The Client is reached through navigating to the help page (e.g.,localhost:xxxx/help), selecting the method to be tested.
In the lower right corner there is a button named "Test API", click the button and the client will show.
